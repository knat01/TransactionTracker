Top-Level Overall Plan:

The core idea is to build a user-friendly application that takes raw transaction data, uses AI to analyze it, and presents insights in two distinct ways: visually on a dashboard and through a conversational chat interface. The application will act as a personal investment analyst powered by AI.

User Flow:

User Opens Application: The user launches the application on their device (web browser, desktop app, etc.).

Navigation: The user is presented with two main tabs: "Dashboard" and "Chat Analysis".

Data Input (Both Tabs): On either tab, the user will see a clear area to paste their Wealthsimple transaction history. This will likely be a large text area.

Data Submission: The user pastes their data and clicks a "Analyze" or similar button.

Data Processing & API Call:

The application receives the raw transaction data.

Crucial Step: The application will need to parse the pasted text to extract relevant information (date, security, action (buy/sell), quantity, price, fees, etc.). This parsing logic is essential.

The parsed data is then sent to the DeepSeek API. The API prompt will be designed to ask for specific analyses and insights based on the transaction data.

DeepSeek API Response: The DeepSeek API processes the data and returns a text-based analysis. This response will likely contain insights, summaries, potential observations, and answers to the implicitly asked questions (based on the prompt).

Dashboard Display:

Data Organization: The parsed transaction data is organized for visualization.

Chart Generation: The application uses charting libraries to generate relevant charts based on the parsed data. Examples:

Portfolio value over time.

Asset allocation (pie chart of holdings).

Profit/loss per security.

Transaction volume over time.

Cost basis vs. current value.

Key Metrics: Display key summary statistics like total profit/loss, average holding period, best/worst performing assets.

Chat Analysis Display:

The raw text response from the DeepSeek API is displayed in the chat interface.

The user can then interact with the chatbot by asking follow-up questions about the analysis or specific trades.

The application sends the user's questions along with the original transaction data (or a summary) back to the DeepSeek API for further analysis and responses.

Application Plan (High-Level):

Frontend Development:

User Interface (UI): Design the layout with the two tabs (Dashboard and Chat Analysis). Ensure a clear area for pasting data.

Data Handling: Implement the logic to capture the pasted text.

Dashboard Components: Integrate charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts) to display visual data.

Chat Interface: Create a simple chat window to display DeepSeek's responses and allow user input.

State Management: Manage the application's state (e.g., the raw data, parsed data, API response).

Backend (or Client-Side Processing for Simplicity initially):

Data Parsing: Develop the core logic to parse the Wealthsimple transaction history. This is a critical step as the format can be complex. Regular expressions or dedicated parsing libraries might be needed.

API Integration: Implement the communication with the DeepSeek API. This involves:

Formatting the data into a suitable prompt for the API.

Sending the request to the DeepSeek API endpoint.

Handling the API response.

Data Storage (Optional Initially): For a basic version, you might not need a database. However, for future enhancements (saving past analyses, user profiles), a database would be required.

DeepSeek API Integration:

Prompt Engineering: Craft effective prompts to the DeepSeek API to get the desired insights. This will be iterative and require experimentation. Consider asking for summaries, identification of trends, risk assessment, etc.

Handling Responses: Process the API response to display it appropriately in the chat and potentially extract data for the dashboard.

Deployment:

Choose a platform to host your application (e.g., Netlify, Vercel for web apps; Electron for desktop apps).
